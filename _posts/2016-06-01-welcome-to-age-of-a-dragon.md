## Intro

This is the beginning of your adventure as well as my own. I have decided to get serious about making this game. I've had the idea for
for a few years now, but haven't had a good way to implement it. I tried a couple of different engines, including LibGDX and LWJGL, but
they just weren't right for me. I have since found the Phaser HTML5 engine, which I really enjoy using. It's exactly the level of engine I
have been looking for, and Age of a Dragon will be my first big project using it.

## Game Synopsis

In Age of a Dragon, you play a newly-hatched dragon. You can't do much at first. Your legs aren't strong enough to be able to jump too
high, and your wings are just little nubs on your back. And don't even think about being able to breathe fire! So you need to make it through
the world as best you can, and explore to find everything you can. As you progress, you'll grow and gain new powers.

## Development Style

For this game, I'm going to use an iterative development style. I'll have a certain amount of work to do to consider myself done with the
current iteration, and then I'll move on to the next one. My next post will have my current iteration goals, because I haven't decided what
they'll be just yet.

Thanks for checking out my game and stay tuned for more updates. I'll also be slowly working on changing this website, but I'm not very
good at front-end development, so those changes won't happen too often.
